# i5
A comprehensive redesign of the [i4 database](https://github.com/scasBot/i4) for the Small Claims Advisory Service. The live version of this project can be accessed at [i5.masmallclaims.org](https://i5.masmallclaims.org)

## Installation

### Updating definitions  
Located in `lang/en/messages.php` is a list of defined terms that may change from year to year (e.g. webmaster's name, email, etc.)â€”all you need to do is to edit their definitions in this file and they will update across the app.

### Setting up the Database

#### System Requirements
Make sure MySQL database is InnoDB format. This will allow for foreign key constraints to be applied. Also remove the Client factory command statement.

#### Migrations  
To create all the necessary database structures, run this command:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

If you need to reverse any changes:  

```sh
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
```

#### Running a Seeder

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

### Running The App  
Upload the files to your document root, or if you are running your own server, use the following command  

```sh
php artisan serve
```
