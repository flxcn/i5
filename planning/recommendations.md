# Recommendations

## Major Design Approaches
- Laravel approach, MVC
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile Friendly
- As timeless as possible

## Critical Feature Changes
- change login username to email rather than names
    - guaranteed uniqueness, and prevent small errors like extra spacing (can be difficult)
- explain exactly what the default password is, rename it

## Coding
- webmaster constant in env?
- no iframes
- footers (sticky?)

## Aesthetic / Branding
- Remove the quotes table
- Remove the cat gifs
- Remove the punchcard (cool, but it's not really that useful)
- Unify the text font to Times New Roman
    - Georgia is not a suitable option because there is not a uniform baseline for letters/numbers. Currently a mix of serifs and non-serifs in the navbar.
- Replace favicon with the current logo
- Secondary color: crimson, #A51C30
- Switch over to Bootstrap 5 (buttons, inputs fields will be consistent across the board)
- Consistent grey background
