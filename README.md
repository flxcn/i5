# i5
A comprehensive redesign of the [i4 database](https://github.com/scasBot/i4) for the Small Claims Advisory Service. The live version of this project can be accessed at [i5.masmallclaims.org](https://i5.masmallclaims.org)

## Installation

### Setting up the Database

#### System Requirements
Make sure MySQL database is InnoDB format. This will allow for foreign key constraints to be applied. In addition, i5 relies on the ability to operate a mail server. Also remove the Client factory command statement.

#### Defining the Environment

In order to populate the database with information, you will need to first define the database details. Located in `.env` are the following definitions that you can adjust if necessary. `DB_DATABASE` should be kept as is.

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=8889
DB_DATABASE=i5
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

Next, you will also need to define the mail account through which user emails will be sent:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailhog
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

#### Migrations  
To create all the necessary database structures, run this command:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

If you need to reverse any changes:  

```sh
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
```

#### Running a Seeder

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

### Running The App  
Upload the files to your document root, or if you are running your own server, use the following command  

```sh
php artisan serve
```

### Updating definitions  

Located in `lang/en/messages.php` is a list of defined terms that may change from year to year (e.g. webmaster's name, email, etc.)â€”all you need to do is to edit their definitions in this file and they will update across the app.
